# Minified-guided-learning-solution-GLS-
GLS is a solution that enables step by step guidance on top of any web interface.
I build a guided learning frontend engine written in javascript. Player that will eventually run a guide on google.com. 

***JSONP Json guid*** - The json represents a sample guide created in guidedlearning.oracle.com that the frontend engine will need to render on the google.com. A guide is a sequence of steps, each step represents a specific tooltip with a specific text on a specific element in the page.
