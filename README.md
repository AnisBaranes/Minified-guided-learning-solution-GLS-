# Minified-guided-learning-solution-GLS-
GLS is a solution that enables step by step guidance on top of any web interface.
I build a guided learning frontend engine written in javascript. Player that will eventually run a guide on google.com. 

***JSONP Json guid*** - The json represents a sample guide that the frontend engine will need to render on the google.com. A guide is a sequence of steps, each step represents a specific tooltip with a specific text on a specific element in the page.

I impemented player.js  - so that upon loading google.com in a browser the sample guide will run and display tooltip on the screen.
The script I wrote can be injected into google using DevTools.
